<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Blockchain is one of the emerging technologies and rightfully so. It ports a centralized system into a decentralized system which is secure and cannot be messed with. 

Our team plans to use this beautiful piece of tech to implement innovative solutions into the HealthCare sector. Recently, due to this pandemic, we have seen the halthcare sector struggle at some aspects. And we plan to address that. The idea is build a decentralized application, that keeps track of pandemic/epidemic cases(can also be a infectious disease on a small scale), throught the healthcare system. The app itself is simple. All one has to do it, login, add the patient's name and id, and specify if he is being tested positive or negative. The app is simple and intuitive to use.


The simple act of having the cases in a decentralised network has a large scale impact. People around the world can know who is infected and can take care of themselves. And we will have a exact number of cases available. We don't have to rely on partial news, or politicians trying to scare us, or convince us that things arent bad. Right now, the information is salvaged from news, govt sources, which are centralised and can be fudges to one's advantage. Our app while being simple, also doesn't allow the leak of important personal data. All it requires is unique id, name , and result. No extra information, no fuss. 

Simplicity at it's best.
